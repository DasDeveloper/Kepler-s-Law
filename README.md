# Kepler-s-Law

- Simulation of Newton's second law of motion to prove Kepler's laws (3). 

First law : The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
Second law : A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
Third law: The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the length of the semi-major axis of its orbit.

First law can be demonstrated by simply calculating the the a and b axis. If they are not equal, the orbit is an ellipse. '
Second law can be de
